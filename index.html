          <p class="m3-justify m3-text-white m3-xlarge">It's 2 a.m. on a chilly mid-March morning and I am tossing and
            turning on
            the sofa in the
            living room of my small Harlem apartment in New York, hoping I'm not disturbing Greg, my husband, peacefully
            sleeping in our adjacent bedroom. Unbearable aches accompany my fever, which just jumped from low grade to
            102°
            and persistent chills now violently shake my body. The past three days I've been lethargic and a little achy
            but
            I chalked those complaints up to jet lag. I had just returned from a two-week Scandinavia trip for work.
            Tonight, with the arrival of these new dreadful symptoms, I'm suddenly fearing the worst: thoughts of the
            coronavirus flood my mind.

            As a writer, I travel the globe for a living, logging thousands of miles per year. It may sound glamorous,
            and
            it can be, but it's also a lot of trains, planes, automobiles, new people, foreign customs, crowds and
            interviewing sources close up for stories. It hadn't seemed like a risky business until now — the numbers of
            dead and dying climbing. It's a sleepless night consumed with worry. <a

          <div class="expandMoreContent " id="para2">
            <p class="m3-justify m3-text-white m3-xlarge">The first hint I had that something wasn't right was on a
            Friday.
            I felt more tired than normal and by the time I went to bed I was exhausted. That was a particularly tough
            weekend.
            On the Monday, I started getting pains in my legs, which became excruciating. I thought it was a trapped
            nerve
            and took some paracetamol but the doctors later told me the virus had gone directly into my muscles. I had a
            cough but it wasn't persistent, which people think is always the sign. I was bed-bound for over a week but
            then once I did get out - to the local petrol station to get some provisions - that was when it hit me.
            I got back home feeling freezing cold and shivering. At one point I had four hot water bottles on the sofa
            and
            two blankets and I just could not get warm.
            Then the fever set in. It felt like my body was on fire, and I was getting splitting headaches. I couldn't
            eat
            anything, I was vomiting and absolutely wringing wet with sweat, and then my breathing started to get more
            difficult.
            I'm asthmatic and that really worried me, but I still thought I could ride this out at home. Within a few
            more
            days I was slipping in and out of consciousness and I have vague recollections of my 15-year-old son telling
            me he'd called 111 [the NHS non-emergency helpline] for me. The paramedics arrived and I remember hearing
            one
            radio the ambulance driver outside saying: "She's very poorly, we need to bring her in." He put an oxygen
            mask
            on me and carried me out to the vehicle.
            One of my kids had called my mother, June, and she was there watching. That was one of the hardest things:
            seeing the look of helplessness on her face. But she couldn't come close because she has a heart condition
            and
            is at high risk if she catches the virus.
            When we arrived at hospital, we were in a queue of ambulances just waiting to off-load patients at A&E. I
            was
            lying there for about three hours until it was our turn. They put me in a wheelchair and I remember them
            saying they had no cubicles, they were full to capacity.
            I sat there with my eyes closed listening to everything - people rushing around, phones ringing, general
            commotion.
            The nurse said: "I have to swab you for Covid-19." He stuck the swab stick so far down the back of my throat
            that I was retching, and then just as I was recovering, he said: "Now I have to do it up your nostrils."
            That
            was followed by a raft of blood tests and a chest X-Ray.
            I felt pummelled. All I could think was "What the hell's going on?" I felt like passing out. I remember
            another nurse coming over and telling me: "Just to let you know, your X-Ray results have come back - you've
            got pneumonia in the lungs and you'll have to be on oxygen 24/7."
            At one point, I felt the most almighty pain in my chest, like I was being compressed with slabs of concrete.
            They told me it was the pneumonia attacking my lungs and they gave me a shot of morphine. That was followed
            by
            terrible stabbing pains in my stomach, as bad as labour contractions, and I cried out: "I can't take this
            anymore! I can't carry on!" By the time the pains subsided, I was almost delirious. <a

          <p class="m3-justify m3-text-white m3-xlarge">When pathologist Amy Rapkiewicz began the grim process of opening up the coronavirus
            dead to learn how their bodies went awry, she found damage to the lungs, kidneys and liver consistent with
            what doctors had reported for months.
            But something was off.
            Rapkiewicz, who directs autopsies at NYU Langone Health, noticed that some organs had far too many of a
            special cell rarely found in those places. She had never seen that before, yet it seemed vaguely familiar.
            She raced to her history books and — in a eureka moment — found a reference to a 1960s report on a patient
            with dengue fever.
            In dengue, a mosquito-borne tropical disease, she learned, the virus appeared to destroy these cells, which
            produce platelets, leading to uncontrolled bleeding. The novel coronavirus seemed to amplify their effect,
            causing dangerous clotting. She was struck by the parallels: “Covid-19 and dengue sound really different,
            but the cells that are involved are similar.”
            Autopsies have long been a source of breakthroughs in understanding new diseases, from HIV/AIDS and Ebola to
            Lassa fever — and the medical community is counting on them to do the same for covid-19, the disease caused
            by the novel coronavirus. With a vaccine probably many months away in even the most optimistic scenarios,
            autopsies are becoming a critical source of information for research into possible treatments.
            When the pandemic hit the United States in late March, many hospital systems were too overwhelmed trying to
            save lives to spend too much time delving into the secrets of the dead. But by late May and June, the first
            large batch of reports — from patients ranging in age from 32 to 90 years who died at a half-dozen
            institutions — were published in quick succession. The investigations have confirmed some of our early
            hunches of the disease, refuted others — and opened up new mysteries about the pathogen that has killed more
            than 500,000 people worldwide.<a

        <div class="expandMoreContent" id="para4">
          <p class="m3-justify m3-text-white m3-xlarge">I started getting short of breath. So definitely does attack
            your
            respiratory system and it
            hits it hard. So I think like, that was one of the worst symptoms, because I woke up in the middle of the
            night
            and I was disoriented. I wasn't able to breathe.

            I wasn't able to get anybody's attention. And I think at that point you started sitting down and having a
            conversation with yourself. Like, OK, this is it for me. This is it for me and my children. I won't ever see
            them again-type of thing. But I thank God that he was with me. Was able to wake him up, wake my husband up
            to
            let them know that something wasn't right.

            When I first got here, they wasn't going to test me because I didn't fit the criteria. After some CAT scans
            and
            a couple of tests, they decided to go ahead and test me. And they came back and they told me that I tested
            positive.

            My family is on 14-day quarantine. I haven't seen my children, haven't seen my husband in days now.

            There is no treatment for coronavirus. So what they're treating is, they can treat a symptom. So if I have a
            fever, they could treat it with Tylenol. If I have a cough, they could treat you with cough medicine. But my
            body has to fight it off. So I have to take the time to rest, make sure that I'm trying to keep down as much
            food as I can and let my body do its job.

            I've been here, I think I lost about 15 pounds, so I don't know what I'll be looking like when I get up out
            of
            here. I got to get my hair done y'all. Talk about my bonnet.

            Everybody's making jokes about it. I don't take it personal. I think the only thing that kind of bothered me
            was
            to see myself on the news, to see my local news station speak of this situation but not even know
            wholeheartedly
            like what was going on.

            It's a lot scarier when you see it on the TV or when you read about it than what it actually is. But I'm not
            going to sit up here and pretend like it's a joke. Definitely has taken me away from my family, gave me some
            breathing problems, and sat me down for a while to reevaluate myself and kind of, you know, my life. I know
            after this, you know, I want to get out and do more.

            So just make sure that you guys are keeping your kids safe and you're keeping yourself safe as well. That's
            the
            best advice that I can give anybody. Just make sure to y'all are paying attention to your body. Your body
            will
            let you know when something's wrong, and if it's telling you something is wrong, then go ahead and get
            tested.
